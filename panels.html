                    <h3>Week 1 Assignment: Your Health Context Persona</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> With your partner, come up with a “persona” for a patient with the chronic disease you chose.  Please start a team google doc, and in it put down the details of your patient’s story which should include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Demographics (name, age, sex, ethnicity, etc.)</li>
                                <li>A “history of present illness” – what’s the story of how/when this person’s disease started and progressed to this point? What were the first symptoms? What is the current stage or level of symptoms?</li>
                                <li>Some medications that the patient currently takes, with dose, route, frequency</li>
                                <li>A few other clinically relevant details for this patient, e.g.:</li>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Allergies</li>
                                    <li>Past medical or surgical history</li>
                                    <li>Significant family history</li>
                                    <li>Social history (alcohol/drug use, smoking etc.)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>While your persona may not have finished the trajectory of their illness, provide a description of the progression of the disease/health issue as it moves along its course to possible cure or ultimately to its end stage</li>
                            </ul>
                        
                        <li>This “Health Context Persona” will be used by you and your partner for the rest of the class homeworks… so thought that you put into it now will be helpful all semester! </li>
                        </ul>
                    
                </ul></p>

                    <h3>Week 2 Assignment: EHR Exercise</h3>
                    <ul>
                            Use the Practice Fusion EHR to document a SOAP note on your HC Patient. <br />
                            
                            SOAP Note: Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan:<br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>Subjective – Patient’s description of their reason for a visit/chief complaint (in their own words)</li>
                                <li>Objective – Provider’s observation (e.g., measurements e.g., weight, vitals, physical exam findings</li>
                                <li>Assessment (provider’s impression, diagnosis)</li>
                                <li>Plan – Additional tests/treatment plan (e.g. order tests, prescribe meds, outside referrals)</li>
                                <li>Here are a few <u><a href="https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/files/webfm-uploads/documents/med-student/pcc/pds-example-soap-note-chronic-problem.pdf" target="_blank"> examples  </a></u></li>
                             </ul>
                            <br />
                              Exercise Steps:
                              <ol>
                                <li>Create your account in Practice Fusion. You will get an invite, practice code is: DD77FR5NEC</li>
                                <li>Register your patient - fill in as much detail as possible and play around with settings</li>
                                <li>Check in your patient and chart a SOAP Note</li>
                                    <ol type = "a">
                                        <li>Select “charts” on side panel</li>
                                         <li>Select your patient</li>
                                         <li>Select “New Encounter (SOAP)</li>
                                    </ol>
                                <li>Be sure to record something in each field</li>
                                    <ol type = "a">
                                        <li>Chief Complaint (why did the patient come to the office today?</li>
                                        <li>Vitals (notice calculated BMI)</li>
                                        <li>Diagnoses (record at least your chronic disease, notice the mapped ICD and SNOMED codes, we will cover in future class)</li>
                                        <li>Allergies (add one! Notice there are a lot of allergy components, including reaction, severity, onset, etc.)</li>
                                        <li>Medications (add a few medications related to your chronic disease, just “Record,” don’t “Order”)</li>
                                        <li>Social History (be creative)</li>
                                        <li>Past Medical History (be creative)</li>
                                        <li>The SOAP elements of the note. Play with the built in templates. You can stop after PLAN of SOAP  (don’t bother with orders, attachments, etc.)</li>

                                    <li>Check out the clinical decision support items at the top, especially if any are related to your disease.</li>
                                    <li>When writing SOAP, check out the “Add patient info” and template functionality that can make note writing faster. Try using a community template (add one to “My Templates” in settings).</li>
                                    <li>After you save and sign your note, check out the patient summary page and see what data made its way there. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li> For your Health Context Persona, look up relevant codes on a few different coding systems.  For example, list some standard codes for some medications your patient might take, some ICD-10 codes for their diagnoses, and perhaps map some of these to SNOWMED codes. </li>
                        <li> Then, spend some time exploring the SMART on FHIR web page: <u><a href=" http://docs.smarthealthit.org" target="_blank"> here </a></u> </li>
                        <li> Look at the sandbox, the sandbox data, and the tutorials.  Come up with a brief proposal for a simple web app you will build for the following week’s assignment, one that will utilize the SMART on FHIR framework, and that will access information about a patient or patients in one of the sample data sets provided.  Deborah and I will review your proposals and give you feedback before you start building for the week 4 assignment.</li>
